## About the project

This is a simple showcase of my Robot framework automation knowledge.
To run with browser open, run the following command in the root folder:

```bash
robot --exclude headless demoqa/
```

To run in headless mode, run the following command:
```bash
robot --exclude local demoqa/
```
